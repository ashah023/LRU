Instructions for compiling test programs:

Navigate to /root/Desktop/Assignment4/ and type make into the terminal to make both of the test programs for part 1 and part 2 of this assignment.

In this folder, the makefiles for the test programs for part 1 and part 2 can be found in the folder Test Programs.


Instructions for running the test programs:

To run the test programs, navigate to /root/Desktop/Assignment4/ and, after making the executables, enter "./test_part_1" to test the first part of the assignment. No other parameters need to be supplied. Similarly, to run part 2 of the assignment, type in "./test_part_2" .

For information on what the test programs output as well as our observations, please view the report.txt file.
